Group 3 - Learning Nim Game Change Log

Start:

Added NimLogic.cs as a public static class for containing all methods which check and use Logic specific to the game of Nim.
This class will be an example of Logical Cohesion, storing methods together that are related logically. Methods will
be extracted from Game.cs and BoardState.cs into this class, where logical.

//Moved to NimLogic.cs as IsMoveValid(BoardState bs1, BoardState bs2);
//public bool checkIfValid(BoardState change)
//{
//    if (this.RowACount > change.RowACount && (change.RowBCount == this.RowBCount && change.RowCCount == this.RowCCount))
//        return true;
//    if (this.RowBCount > change.RowBCount && (change.RowACount == this.RowACount && change.RowCCount == this.RowCCount))

Moved checkIfValid from BoardState into NimLogic.cs as IsMoveValid. This move was made to make the intentions of the method
more obvious, and to place it where it logically belongs. A BoardState object should not perform a check for a valid
move from one state to another, it is merely a container for state information, not the rules of the game.

I changed the method to be static as it is contained within the static class NimLogic. This will allow this simple check,
which is likely to be used frequently, to be accessed throughout the program.

public static bool IsMoveValid(BoardState currentState, BoardState proposedState)
	{
            if (currentState.RowACount > proposedState.RowACount &&
                proposedState.RowACount >= 0)
            {
                if (currentState.RowBCount == proposedState.RowBCount &&
                    currentState.RowCCount == proposedState.RowCCount) return true;
            }

            if (currentState.RowBCount > proposedState.RowBCount &&
                proposedState.RowBCount >= 0)
            {
                if (currentState.RowACount == proposedState.RowACount &&
                    currentState.RowCCount == proposedState.RowCCount) return true;
            }

            if (currentState.RowCCount > proposedState.RowCCount &&
                proposedState.RowCCount >= 0)
            {

Moved chooseRandomMove from Game.cs to NimLogic.cs as ChooseRandomMoveWithinGameConstaints.
This is a more logical location for this method.This method must apply the rules of Nim and therefore 
logically belongs in NimLogic.cs. Another viable location for this method would be within an AI class,
as it is likely that nothing else would need to Choose a ran

public static BoardState ChooseRandomMoveWithinGameConstraints(BoardState currentBoard)
    {
        BoardState validRandomMove = new BoardState(currentBoard);
        Random randomGen = new Random();

        do
        {
            int randomRow = randomGen.Next(0, 3);

            if (randomRow == 0)
            {
                if (validRandomMove.RowACount <= 0) continue;
                else validRandomMove.RowACount -= randomGen.Next(1, validRandomMove.RowACount + 1);
            }
            else if (randomRow == 1)
            {
                if (validRandomMove.RowBCount <= 0) continue;
                else validRandomMove.RowBCount -= randomGen.Next(1, validRandomMove.RowBCount + 1);
            }
            else if (randomRow == 2)
            {
                if (validRandomMove.RowCCount <= 0) continue;

Start: 

I forgot modify Game.cs to use ChooseRandomMoveWithinGameConstraints rather than chooseRandomMove(), due to this
the previous build is broken.

Start:

        //Replaced by NimLogic.EveryPossibleBoardState()
        //public static BoardState[] GetAllPossibleStates()
        //{
        //    BoardState[] states = new BoardState[192];
        //    int i = 0;

        //    for (int rA = 0; rA <= 3; rA++)
        //    {
        //        for (int rB = 0; rB <= 5; rB++)
        //        {
        //            for (int rC = 0; rC <= 7; rC++)
        //            {
        //                BoardState b = new BoardState();
        //                b.Frequency = 0;
        //                b.StateValue = 0;
        //                b.RowACount = rA;
        //                b.RowBCount = rB;
        //                b.RowCCount = rC;

        //                states[i] = new BoardState(b);
        //                i++;
        //            }
        //        }
        //    }

        //    return states;
        //}

I moved GetAllPossibleStates from BoardState.cs to NimLogic.cs. I believe this is a better place for this method
as it is already static, and it doesn't feel right being a member of BoardState. I also replaced the return
type of BoardState[] with an IEnumerable<BoardState>. This is in response to the Computer Science base rule
of favoring Iterators to Lists. This way we can use this method in LINQ queries to find a specific state
or for it's original use of compiling a list of all BoardStates.

        /// <summary>
        /// Used to provide a list of all possible BoardStates.
        /// </summary>
        /// <returns></returns>
        public static IEnumerable<BoardState> EveryPossibleBoardState()
        {
            for (int rowA = 0; rowA <= 3; rowA++)
            {
                for (int rowB = 0; rowB <= 5; rowB++)
                {
                    for (int rowC = 0; rowC <= 7; rowC++)
                    {
                        BoardState b = new BoardState();
                        b.Frequency = 0;
                        b.StateValue = 0;
                        b.RowACount = rowA;
                        b.RowBCount = rowB;
                        b.RowCCount = rowC;

                        yield return b;
                    }
                }
            }
        }

1:45PM 4/15/2013 - Justin Ward

Start:

        //Replaced by GetAllValidMoves in NimLogic.cs
        //private List<BoardState> compileListOfValidMoves()
        //{
        //    List<BoardState> ret = new List<BoardState>();

        //    for (int i = 0; i < BoardData.Length; i++)
        //        if (NimLogic.IsMoveValid(currentBoard, BoardData[i]))
        //            ret.Add(BoardData[i]);

        //    return ret;
        //}

I moved compileListOfValidMoves() from Game.cs to NimLogic.cs as GetAllValidMoves. This required me to add a parameter
for the currentBoardState, making the purpose of the method more apparent. I also changed the return type from List<BoardState>
to an IEnumberable<BoardState> based upon the rule of favoring Iterators over Lists. The change of GetAllPossibleStates from
being a member of BoardState to being a member of NimLogic, allows me to now use that method within GetAllValidMoves, making
it's body simpler and more straight-forward.

        /// <summary>
        /// Used to determine all possible moves based upon the current BoardState
        /// </summary>
        /// <param name="currentState">Current Game's BoardState</param>
        /// <returns>Each valid move from the current state</returns>
        public static IEnumerable<BoardState> GetAllValidMoves(BoardState currentState)
        {
            foreach (var b in EveryPossibleBoardState())
            {
                if (IsMoveValid(currentState, b))
                    yield return b;
            }
        }

Start:

I added NimLearningAI.cs to be a class representing an AI logic, and to contain all that pertain to the AI's actions. These
methods will be moved from their current location in Game.cs.

Start:

    public class NimLearningAI
    {
        private int GamesPlayed = 0;
        List<BoardState> BoardStateCatalog;

        public NimLearningAI()
        {
            Refresh();
        }

        /// <summary>
        /// Resents the AI's BoardStateCatalog and GamesPlayed, reseting it to a
        /// completely "dumb" state.
        /// </summary>
        public void Refresh()
        {
            BoardStateCatalog = new List<BoardState>();

            foreach (var b in NimLogic.EveryPossibleBoardState())
                BoardStateCatalog.Add(b);

            GamesPlayed = 0;
        }
    }

Added a method to NimLearningAI.cs named Refresh() which resets the AI to a "Dumb" state, this is
also used to initialize the AI on creation.

Start:

        //Replaced by ApplyGameDataToCatalog in NimLearningAI.cs
        public void IncorperateData()

            int sign = TempList.Count % 2 == 0 ? 1 : -1;

            for (int i = 0; i < TempList.Count; i++)
            {
                float weight = (sign * i) / (float)TempList.Count;

                TempList[i].StateValue = weight;

                var bs = BoardData.First(b => b == TempList[i]);
                bs.ApplyNewData(TempList[i]);

                // flip sign for next turn
                sign *= -1;
            }

            TempList.Clear();
        }

Replaced IncorperateData in Game.cs with ApplyGameDataToCatalog in NimLearningAI.cs. Have not implemented this
change yet, as NimLearningAI is not entirely complete. This change is purely for Cohesion purposes, only the
AI needs a list of States which it uses to make moves, therefore only the AI needs this method.

        /// <summary>
        /// This method takes in all BoardStates that occured in a game, in reverse order,
        /// and applies a weight to each, and then applies that new data to the corresponding state

            int weightSign = boardStates.Count % 2 == 0 ? 1 : -1;

            for (int i = 0; i < boardStates.Count; i++)
            {
                float weight = (weightSign * i) / (float)boardStates.Count;
                boardStates[i].StateValue = weight;
                BoardStateCatalog.First(b => b == boardStates[i]).ApplyNewData(boardStates[i]);
                weightSign *= -1;
            }

            GamesPlayed++;

and takeTurn in Game.cs.

Start:

Added a class named UserConsoleInput which will be a static class for containing all methods required to gather Console
Input from the User. This is Logical Cohesion but is a step toward serperating our Game from the Console. This also allows us
to gather input anywhere else without creating unneeded objects. A superclass could be extracted from this named UserInput,
which would then be extended by different classes based upon their UI used. As our concern now is not using a different UI, we'll
save that change for later.
