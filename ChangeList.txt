Group 3 - Learning Nim Game Change Log

12:00 PM 4/15/2013 - Justin Ward

Start:

Added NimLogic.cs as a public static class for containing all methods which check and use Logic specific to the game of Nim.
This class will be an example of Logical Cohesion, storing methods together that are related logically. Methods will
be extracted from Game.cs and BoardState.cs into this class, where logical.
