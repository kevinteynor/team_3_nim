- BoardState.cs
	- completely removed previous "RowA/B/C" references from all code, replaced with references to the RowCounts[] array.
	- renamed variables inside ApplyNewData() to make meaning easier to interpret.
	- compressed PrintBoard() function to remove reused code for different rows. Allows scaleability for more than 3 rows.
	- renamed variables in Equals() to be less confusing.
	- overrode the Boardstate.Equals(BoardState) for better efficiency, used it in the .Equals(Object) function.
	- changed equallity checking logic to account for more than a 3-wide board.
